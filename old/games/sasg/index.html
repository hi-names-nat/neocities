        <p>
          I love Game Jams. I love running them, I love participating in them. This game, Steady As She Goes, was made for Ludum Dare 52, the theme was "Harvest". 
        </p>
        <p>
        I remember struggling a lot at the start of this jam. It felt like the theme was giving me nothing to work with. I didn't want to do the obvious and make a farming game. I sat around for a few hours just trying to get ideas. Eventually. I knew I had to do something, So I headed for an art museum.
        </p>
        <p>At that museum is where I found the inspiration for Steady As She Goes. A work called <a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1982.178">"Power Plant II"</a> made me think of a concept where the player must manage the aspects of <i>some sort</i> of power plant. Coming home, the idea developed and intertwined with my love of retro Sci-Fi such as Star Trek: TOS into Steady As She Goes, a game about being an overworked head engineer of a starship, having to manage your warp drive mid-combat as your captain barks orders at you.</p>
        <p>This is maybe the game I'm the proudest of that exists currently. It's exciting, difficult, and, okay, a bit confusing, but once you learn it even I, an overcritical developer, has to concede that its incredibly exciting.</p>
        <p>Eventually I'll come back to the game and clean it up a bit, make a better tutorial, and maybe a campaign. It may be integrated into a larger game that my partner and I have been talking about, a Star-Trek inspried Tactical FPS, similar to games like Ready or Not, but without the inherent copaganda present in games like that.</p>
        <p>We'll see.</p>
