          I love this game! Originally developed by a team I was unfortunately not a part of for 7DFPS, a 7 day FPS game jam, the lead developer and visionary Josh Wilson decided to continue working on the game and ideally eventually release it as a finished product. During that time, he enlisted me to at first only level design, but eventually complexify the entirety of the game, including improvements to the games basics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game at its core is inspired by Half-Life and Y2K aesthetics. I love both of these things (obviously, you're on my <i>personal neocities site</i> after all) so I was very enthused about the game and its concept. I even came up with some incredibly core world and level designs that I'm excited for people to eventually see!! :3
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't speak much about anything else. I don't think Josh would be too happy with me. However the 7DFPS version (with some improvements by yours truly) is available down below. You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WPKzuzy9UQ&lc=UgwQVTPBAtBkPPbTP7F4AaABAg" style="text-decoration:underline">click here</a> to see something of Josh's that I think about constantly, everyday, every single day of my life no break. (I love Dr. DialUp I love him i love him AA AAA )
        </p>
        <p>Development is still in progress! I have not contibuted to the game as much recently, but I plan to eventually get back into it. It is a project I believe in and it's going to be so exciting to see it finally out there, one day.</p>
