          This one was made for a Game Jam I myself envisioned and ran! The theme was Doors, and the team that we had put together eventually came up with the idea that the player has to find parts to escape a strange hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This one went together fantastic. We had at our disposal the best 3D artist in the group, so our models were absolutely excellent. The development went rather smooth and I was even able to teach two other people on the development of a simple game! I hope both of them are doing well, I have not heard from any of them in a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game came together incredibly fast, and a lot of the development time was focused on creating a very polished product. It feels good to have something that feels this good under my belt, but damn if this game isn't incredibly hard. The main chaser-style enemy is much faster than you, so you have to be smart about your usage of the doors around the area. However, that's confounded because not all doors are 'real' doors, some are mimics that will kill you if you approach them.
        </p>
        <p>I intended to continue the development of this game after its release, however time grew short as I began on other projects and leadership of the aforementioned group. Perhaps one day I will go back and polish the few bits I'm not entirely happy with.</p>
