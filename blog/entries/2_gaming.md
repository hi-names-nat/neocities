\#2! Well. A lot happened huh.

Have been doing this instead of anything more productive because of The Thing that happened. So yeah lol I'll write this blog to do anything but think for any amount of time.

I've been spending a loooot of time recently working on a track to put on the Music page. It's 50 hours in and I think I'm nearing completion. It won't be incredibly perfect and polished the way (ideally) my full release tracks will be, but I wanna drop things here just for fun so Y'all can come back and hopefully always find something new to be excited about. Moreover, I also bought a new piece of hardware, A Yamaha SEQTRAK. I am getting used to it, but the ideal is some tracks I produce on it will turn into full releases, and the others will be put here to sate anyone who's really craving more of my stuff! :3

I might also make some YouTube videos about using the device. That would be really fun!!!!!! In a case of absolute queer providence, the one selling the SEQTRAK was a transfemme like me! So of course we were just chatting for hours and hours even after we traded goods lol. New friend!!!!! that in of itself would have been worth the money I spent!

I just added all four sub-pages of the Games page. It does not at all have all the games I've ever worked on, but its a good start and might stay like that for a while. I wanna move on to the other pages and get those working nicely. Though there's some really fun games there, please check it out if you have nothing better to do!!!!

Also, I made a Bluesky that you can follow me on! I'm gonna add it to the index after I write this post, but I'll link it here too in case :)

Besides that... uhhhhh.... Hmmm. can't think of anything really. IDK what else to write. I guess my feelings? Scared, Determined, a little bit Tired. That should be good!

Thanks for reading!
