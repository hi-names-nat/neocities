# Entry #1 - Some sort of Title
## 10/27/24

Well, where to begin...

I was never good at maintaining Any sort of journal about my life. The Abomination-purple diary that I started 2 years ago still sits on my nightstand, not updated for the better part of a year (and a crazy year, at that). Maybe this being open to the public will motivate me to update it more (or, more likely, less due to fear).

My point is - sorry if this section rots while other sections continue to get updated. I'm not good at this. Honestly I'm not good at any of this - but journalkeeping more than most.

Well I suppose I should just start at what I was doing - and what my plans are until my next entry:

Most of my day today was spent participating in the Splatoween event. (Wizard FTW, but I knew Ninja was always gonna win). I did some setting up for some VSTs. Did you know that you can emulate the Virus, Virus TI, and MicroQ now using a VST wrapper? It's awesome, but it just makes me want a Virus TI more! T-T
My plan is to go hard into trying to write and release a track this week. I've got a lot of (what I hope are) good ideas that I want to extrapolate on, and I've got the time to do it. Besides that, I recently introduced myself to a community led by one of my friends. It feels nice to be a part of a community like that again, and I'm looking forward to make myself a usual there. They are getting into Pro-Wrestling, which... I always knew I was destined to be autistic about. I should take this with the grace of a dying warrior.

Besides that, I've continued to consider updating this site. I really want it all in a viewable state before like- the first week of November. Gives me enough time and lets me start focusing on things other than the site (though of course it will still be a focus!). I hope to release some music (probably a single) before the end of the year. I told myself I will not purchase any more music hardware until I release a track. And I want a bunch of things. So I have to release a track. Lol. Back on this site- After this is written, I plan to write the Games page, then the Soft/hardware page, then I'll be "happy" with it, until I focus on a shrine.

I hope this isn't too long - I think this is the end of this blog post. Well! I hope everyone who reads this has a good day/night/whatever else it might be. Hope you're doing well - at least better than I am

Thanks for reading!
