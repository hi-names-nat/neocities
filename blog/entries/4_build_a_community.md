# Entry #4 - Build A Community

CW: Mention of Suicide

Welcome back to my amazing, lovely audience! (0.5 people)

Sorry it's been a while half-a-person who i will now name... Alex... You know how it is with this part of the year. I'll try to keep this updated, but unfortunately finding the time to do the stuff people (I hope) care about will likely prove to be difficult.

Something I've been focusing on a lot recently is putting together a tool to build local community within my area. I would suggest all of you do this, especially if you're a social minority. Maintaining a tight community in your area you can turn to in case things go sour will likely be important in these next few years. Keep yourselves safe. That has been eating up a lot of my time, and I'm not sure how much I want to share here, since it is local, but I'll definitely at least mention how it's been going and give tips if you yourself are trying to build one. My big one right now is find an artist. A visual artist. Having someone there to be able to make art assets is paramount to get people interested and looking at your server.

It's been a while since I've worked on that track I wanted to get out. I left the computer I produce on at home to visit family, and now we are snowed in here until it's safe enough to go back home. So I haven't worked on music even close to as much as I'd like. I'll also likely have to rebuild my workflow as I will probably give the Macbook I currently produce on (a mistake, I know) to a friend in need of a computer, and re-build my workflow on a windows partition of either my desktop or laptop (both of which currently run Debian). It'll be a process but I'll update here as it goes.

I found an old Akai LPK 25 at my girlfriend's house that belonged to her, and she told me I can take it. I was looking for something like an LPK to compliment the form factor of the SEQTRAK, so I'm quite happy, even though the keys are pretty weird.

I've also been trying to write something I started about a year ago. It started as a 'friend-fic', putting ex-friends of mine into a story that kind of fictionalized and metaphored the situation in which we were at that point in time. I still care about the story I was planning on writing there, so I'm reformatting it as simply a fiction story. It's hard to write though, because thinking about it makes me think about them, and when I think about them, well it makes me want cigarettes and a pistol. I'll eventually post a prototype of it over on the writing page. If I can make it through.

I've also been devoting a lot more time to building Silicon. The level is coming together really well and with it I've started building out AI subsystems and the like. I would really like to have a prototype of the gameplay on the table before the year ends, but I doubt that will be possible because the aforementioned community is the thing of the most urgency right now.

I'm also thinking about taking part in a Game Jam again, I miss doing those and I'd really like to just spend some time building a game and just having that be that after, say, 7 days or maybe 2 weeks? Gives me an excuse to focus on one thing, but I can't do that really before I've got the community rolling.

Well, what else? That it? I'm watching snow fall and listening to the Snowman Theme from Earthbound, a little tradition of mine when the first snow comes (though, the past few years there's been so little snow that I haven't been able to do it). It's nice. I suggest it. Especially with a cup of something warm, be it cocoa, coffee, tea, or hot Dr. Pepper.

Hope you're all staying warm, or cool for those in the southern hemisphere. Thanks for reading!
