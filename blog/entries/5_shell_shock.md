# Entry #5 - Shell Shock & Silicon
## 12/20/24

Hello to the .001 micron of a person who has some interest in this site still after I've failed to update it for... very long

Of course, I do have an excuse being its the holidays and there's a lot of stress going around. I can also say I've been less motivated to both work on the sort of things I like putting here and also work on things at all. Shell shock is a bitch, huh? Regardless a lot of what I'm working on right now isn't ready to show or isn't the type of thing that I should share.

The community I've been working on has (soft)launched! There's about 15 people in the community right now. My goal is to get it to 30 before I begin doing large-scale events and stuff like that.

This is usually the music paragraph.... I haven't done anything with music between now and when I last posted a blog. Man. I'm planning on that being my 'main thing' when the whole events at home start. I should? be able to push something out somewhat quickly as it's really far along the pipeline, I just got unmotivated when I couldn't do exactly the thing that I wanted to (ADHD, am I right). More updates to come. I'm also considering putting the demos I've written for it up here, if I do they'll go in a hidden demos page under music that you'll find in this blog post. It doesn't exist right now though.

I've been working on an update to my modpack in Minecraft. I originally made it for 1.16 and have been rebuilding it. It's supposed to be a Vanilla+/Vanilla Extended style modpack. Might post it here at some point with proper attribution to the authors of the mods. It has however made me realize that I'd like to make a minecraft style voxelized sandbox game. I think Minecraft has really gone down in terms of quality since the Microsoft aquisition and I want to make something that replicates the sort of feeling I feel from Beta and Better Than Adventure.

Silicon has been the other main thing I've been working on I finally have Unreal Engine's Team-Based perception system working (you would not believe how much work it was to get it working. Months! Literal months! Absurdity!!). With that the game has a huge leg up as now I just have to build the actual behavior trees for the enemies, then I can start on polishing up the player character for a prototype release. I'll eventually post new content on its page, as well as maybe doing a stream or something about development? I'll link that if I ever end up doing that

I guess thats it. I'm not sure where I'll be in like, 3 months from now but it's at least been fun updating this page. I hope I keep doing it, but if this is the last post I ever make, I'm sorry.

Take care of yourselves.
