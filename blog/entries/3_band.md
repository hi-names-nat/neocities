# Entry #3 - Wanna start a band?
## 11/13/24
Hello to the (I assume) 1 person reading this! How are you?

I decided today that I would write this blog post... But now that I'm actually doing it I'm not sure I have enough to write about. lol. Might as well do it anyway, more blog posts are better than less (maybe)

On the music I've been writing. The track mentioned previously is still progressing. I have what I believe to be one big change to go on it. It requires my voice however, So I haven't found the chance to set up a microphone and really meaningfully record what I need to do. I'm not sure right now if I should borrow my partner's MV7, or should buy myself an SM58 or pre-owned SM7B. That's been the sticking point, and I'll update when I resolve that.

While that track will be released here when it's done, I'm considering pairing it with another that I've had the idea for for years now, and pairing them as an A side / B side on a single. The A side would be called "Audition". I have a lot of ideas for Audition, so we'll see what comes from it

I've also been working on some tracks for "Friends" recently. Right now it is slated to be a 5 track EP, consisting of the tracks with the working titles of "Friends (Intro)", "Drift Station", "Tell me Your Stories", "THANK YOU", and an as-of-yet unnamed track following a panic attack. The sonic gimmick of the album will be a tour through the decades of electronic instruments. With one track utilizing instruments like the ARP Odyssey and Moog Model D, another using the Yamaha DX7, Juno, and D-50, the next utilizing instruments like Virus TI, and a "modern" track utilizing sounds from things like the Minifreak and Wavetable synthesis. Not sure how strong this theme will be in the end because I want the tracks to sound cohesive at the end of the day, but that's what I'm operating on right now. Excited to start posting demos eventually!!

I've also really been wanting an Arturia Keystep, something with a built-in sequencer and arpeggiator would really help my workflow, even though most of my workflow is currently software. My next two purchases for music hardware will likely be a microphone of some sort and a Keystep.

Speaking of Arturia's Step line, I was at my local library today, and they have a Moog Theramini and a Eurorack setup in the makerspace there? I was shocked, it's very cool!! I will definitely be spending a lot of time there.

I posted about the above on my Bluesky. You should follow me there if you like my stuff! We can chat! Please!!! I need friends on it!!!!!

I'm also really wanting to start a band. Of course I'll work on my solo stuff for the time being but I would love to start a band with 1-3 more people, and I'm gonna start looking into someone I could potentially do that with. I'll keep this blog updated, and add my band to the music page if it comes to fruition. Could be very fun!!!

On another note, finally, Silicon Starship is going well, I finally have some fun ideas for the first prototype world, so I'm working on the level for that right now. I'm not sure what the pace is going to be like, but a prototype will be linked here whenever it's ready to be tried! Silicon is shaping up to hopefully be a really fun game and I'm excited for the aforementioned one person reading this to try it out and give us some feedback. :3

On a personal note, I applied for my new Social Security card under my new name. It was quite a process, multiple hours of waiting for 10 minutes of documents. I managed to write an entire little track on the SEQTRAK that I'll probably post a live jam of at some point. Probably gonna title it "Waiting for SSA Jam" lol!

Anyway, that's about it for me this time. Call to action bluesky again, please follow me please? please????????

ahahaha. Up to you of course.

Thanks for reading!
