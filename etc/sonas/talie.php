    <h1>TALIE!</h1>
    <p>Made by one who came much earlier than I did, Talie, AKA Tal, Tali, or Natbun. </p>
    <i>Her description, from old documents...</i>
    <p>
        Comprised of (partly biological) nanomachines which simulate the functioning of organic life.
        These nanomachines work together to simulate cells, which then in turn comprise her vascular, muscular,
        and nerve systems. she breathes, eats, and sleeps, but these are not required for functioning
        for short period (1-2 months).
        She may at anytime restructure these nanomachines to any desired form.
        and for the record, she also doesn't need her vasculature for the same short period.

        my designation is TALIE. I am a prototype of a general use android designed by Dr. Hugo L'Andres and  Dr. Jourou Yasutake.
        <br>
        Dr. Hugo L'Andres is a french-born computer scientist and nanoengineer born in 2022.
        They are credited with their breakthroughs in bionanotechnology and the invention of the first machine to be "sentient",
        the SOPH model (Who happens to be my predecessor!)</p>
