    <h2>You are too kind.</h2>
    <p>Support is unnecessary but greatly appreciated. I currently only have a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/hexdrgn">Ko-Fi</a>, with plans of making a Patreon at some point here.</p>
    <p>Right now, the best thing you can do to support me is to support my work. Follow me on medias and tell your friends who might like my stuff.</p>
    <p>That's all I'd like, at the end of the day. To get my stuff to find the folks who will enjoy it.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
