    <p>Art is pain, as the saying goes. Yet I must create. Welcome to the place where that gets put.</p>
    <p>
        I do a lot of things. I have never been good at reigning in my interests or putting a label on what it is that I do.
        I am a musician, a game developer, an engineer, a tinker, a designer and a dweeb. Many things catch the eye,
        and I am of a full mind to pursue all of them. Jack of all trades: ofttimes better than master of one.

    <p>The fun isn't here though, so let's get to the point.</p>
