        Creating is fun. Creating is also deeply painful. It's a sort of enchantment. You take nothing. A blank page,
        quiet, random bits on a computer, and you paint it with your life energy, the mana contained within yourself.
        Enchantment is costly on one's own mana reserves at the best of times, so the pain is logical.

        I do a lot of things. I have never been interested at reigning in my interests or putting a label on what it is that I do.
        I am a musician, a game developer, an engineer, a tinker, a designer and a dweeb. Many things catch the eye,
        and I am of full mind to pursue all of them. Jack of all trades: ofttimes better than master of one.

        Below is a directory, if you're looking to jump to something quickly. Otherwise I'd really recommend navigating
        to the pages for each individual section, as they will be much more browsable.
