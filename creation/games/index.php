        I have been making games for nearly half my time in this plane. I have been influenced by games for all of my time
        in this plane. Some of my greatest influences are games from the mid-late 90s to early 00s. Games like Half-Life,
        Quake, Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario 64.

        I have a lot of game ideas. Too many to reasonably make in one lifetime. This sucks hard. I have many things I
        would like to put in the world, to finally get them out of me and hand them to you all to carry on. However, I
        have to pick my battles in this regard. I only have at most ten games I will ever be able to make. I must pick
        those that I wish to see in the world the most. <br>It is like picking hatchlings to save from a fire.

        Here's an (incomplete) inventory of the games I've made, plus links if applicable.
