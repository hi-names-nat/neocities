    <p>
        I have been making games for nearly half my time in this plane. I have been influenced by games for all of my time
        in this plane. Some of my greatest influences are games from the mid-late 90s to early 00s. Games like Half-Life,
        Quake, Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario 64, Secret of Mana, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a lot of game ideas. Too many to reasonably make in one lifetime. This sucks hard. I have many things I
        would like to put in the world, to finally get them out of me and hand them to you to carry on. However, I
        have to pick my battles in this regard. I only have at most ten big games I will ever be able to make. I must pick
        those that I wish to see in the world the most. <br>It is like picking hatchlings to save from a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following are games. Some with subpages, some without. Some WIP, some conceptual. If you like an idea on here, go ahead
        and yoink it. Art is a synthesis of influences. We won't make the same game. Anything I'm super defensive about
        won't go on here, or I'll be tight-lipped about specifics.

            in Godot. I started just on the RPG Core, then realized that I kind of needed to make an RPG alongside it.
            <br>
            I intend to make other RPGs at some point. This game is somewhat of an experimentation into how to build
            RPGS in Godot, and to have a base to build off of when I get to it.
            <br>
            RENNE VS. THE INTERNET is about a fox becoming incredibly fed up about the modern state of the internet
            and deciding to acquire the
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/28/seven-people-keys-worldwide-internet-security-web">
                    seven physical keys that control the DNS system.
                </a>
                 It's in early development right now. So not much to show, unfortunately. But looking forward to talking more about it.
