<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>After our communication left the Galaxy we once called home, addressal became harder and harder (not helped by the pioneer's lack of communication and the many, many examples of a location being called "Newn York"), it has become harder and harder for users of Snail Mail, PhysMail, or Email to send their messages to the correct location. This is why the COP's (Coalition of Planets) Addressal and Location department has administered this handbook to anyone who has used the postal service in the last eight Earth years. This small book will go over everything you will need to know to send communication streams in this new era we find ourselves in.</p>

<p>The New System</p>
<p>For you familiar with the Pre-Unification postal service used by all bodies (with the exception of the AGD Empire) this should look quite familiar:</p>
<blockquote><i>123 Road St.<br>
124567 Apartment 2nd floor<br>
Cityville, Our Providence<br>
Countryland, South Continent<br>
Planetoia, System of Sol</i></blockquote>


<p>However, because of recent expansion, and discovery of new life forms which you may wish to send or receive mail from or locate with address, these new sequences will now be added at the end:</p>

<blockquote><i>[Cluster], [Galaxy]<br>
[Dimension], [Rift]<br>
[Plane]</i></blockquote>

<p>IE, now our address in Cityville would read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>123 Road St.<br>
124567 Apartment 2nd floor<br>
Cityville, Our Providence<br>
Countryland, South Continent<br>
Planetoia, System of Sol,<br>
Cluster 4, MWG (Milky Way Galaxy)<br>
Dimension 8-157-A6, Rift 4A<br>
3rd Plane</i></blockquote>

<p>The next sections of this handbook will outline each of these elements individually. (Including the returning ones, for the sake of those who used to inhabit the AGD)</P>
