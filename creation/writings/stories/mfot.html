  (meanwhile in 2239):
<p>In Times Square, New York City, a holoscreen displaying various news propaganda suddenly cuts to a new image. It's a woman. Seemingly in her 130s. Wrinkles only beginning to form on her perfect skin.</p>
<p><i>"Breaking news, as the 'Man from another time', Perry Gabriels, was killed in a craft explosion just outside of B-102 Delta in Andromeda mere moments ago. Him and his band of rag-tag pirates, The Bloody Brigands, had been terrorizing the local mining space in those two light years for decades now. We have an insider scoop from one of the officers involved."</i></p>
<p>A very, very young man is looking at the camera, wearing the usual police craft combat jumpsuit. His sidearm, a F-N 00 point phaser, seems to have just been recently used, as both clips are stationed on the magcharge unit of his suit.</p>
<p>The reporter begins questioning the young man, who seems to be ready for the coming onslaught.</p>
<p><i>"We Have Rick Pines here. Hello Ricky."</i></p>
<p><i>"Hello!"</i></p>
<p><i>"Now tell me, what exactly happened that the man from another time was killed?"</i></p>
<p><i>"Ah. Now, as we all know, his little group of bandits had been causing a great deal of disturbance with the manufacturing district here in Delta. We finally tracked down their hideout and, while trying to make a run for it, managed to destroy the command pod of their vessel."</i></p>
<p><i>"Interesting, now, what are the plans now to do with him? Will we revive him, or let him stay dead?"</i></p>
<p><i>"Now, that's a good question. Usually we'd just let him float off into space, but his status as the first successful instance of cryo-stasis is something of an ace up his sleeve. The History and Astrological units of the  United Republic of Earth are currently having an emergency meeting to decide what to do with him."</i></p>
<p><i>"Very interesting. Anything else to add before we let you go?"</i></p>
<p><i>"Yeah. We're lucky we didn't strike the Alcubierre drive. A black hole this close to Human territory would not exactly be heralded as the best day in human history"</i></p>
<p>He laughs. So does the reporter.</p>
<p><i>"Well Ricky, thank you for doing this."</i></p>
<p><i>"Thank you for having me"</i></p>
The reporter returns to the screen.
<p><i>"That is all the news at the moment. Keep your televisions tuned here to PARACNNFOX to keep an eye on any updates on the situation. I'm Gloria Borger, signing off."</i></p>
<p>The screen cuts back to it's regular scan of distorted images and propaganda.</p>
