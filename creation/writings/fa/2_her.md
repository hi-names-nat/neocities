You're gonna fucking fumble this

The closest you've ever felt to another soul

You're gonna fumble it

She knows you 

She KNOWS you. 

She knows what you are

She sees what lies within

You are nothing. She knows

She knows

She knows. 


Why 

Why

Why

Why does it seem

Like

She wants to be there

Why does it seem like

You've found someone who wants to give you what you give to them

You can't 

Pretend

Like you

Deserve

This

You are a fool to think

Even for a second

That

You could be

Anything

To one 

As incredible.

# 


It is unfortunate. 

It is the truth. 

You cannot allow yourself to believe in a world

Where you are not

Alone

There is no

There is no

There is no

None

It is impossible

It is 

Impossible

It must be

It must be

It must be

Because what are you

When the mask falls

What are you

Under the curtain

There is no answer

Only blood.
