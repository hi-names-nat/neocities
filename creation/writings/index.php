    <p>Ah, literacy. Doesn't it suck?</p>
    <p>I struggle with words. I also write a whole hell of a lot. I'm always writing something. Be it a novel that I know will never be released
    or a small note to get my thoughts straight.</p>
    <p>Words, unfortunately, have power. They are an incredibly efficient and direct way to express oneself. I attempt to exploit them for this purpose, to the best of my abilities.</p>
    <p>Most of my smaller and heat-of-the-moment writings will be placed within the <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> section. In all liklihood that is where the majority of the writings
    on this website will end up. However, there will be some added here, as i complete or retire larger projects, or add stuff to the Forever Archive.</p>

                An unfinished draft for a half-life fanwork based upon Eli Vance & Isaac Kleiner's perspectives
                during the Black Mesa Incident. Rough, amateurish and quite embarassing. But it's one of the few bits
                of writing I still have from this point in my life.
