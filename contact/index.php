    <p>To get in contact with me, I would suggest either sending me a message on Bsky if its casual, or sending me an
    email at <a href="mailto:hexaaelia@hexaaelia.gay">hexaaelia@hexaaelia.gay</a>. Email can be anything, be it casual
    questions, more 'professional' questions, or a concern about the site. Though I do not do commissions, please do
    not ask. However, I am more than willing to discuss specifics of my projects, my involvement, and accomplishments.</p>
    <p>QnA will eventually also be a great place to ask me questions in a medium that's more my-speed. It's still
    being worked on unfortunately. Will update this when it's ready.</p>
    <p>'ppreciate it.</p>
